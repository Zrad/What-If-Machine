# What-If-Machine
Raspberry Pi-Powered What-If machine

This project is for this post where I made a TV that plays Futurama tv episodes based on a button press. There are three services to create, but only the buttons.service will start at boot. The other two are started and stopped depending on the button presses in the buttons.py script.
